## Holy Grail Application
> This project is a classic Holy Grail layout built entirely using HTML5 and CSS, without any JavaScript or frameworks. It serves as a practical exercise to revisit and reinforce core concepts of semantic HTML structure, CSS layout techniques (like Flexbox), and responsive design principles. The layout includes a header, footer, main content area, and a sidebarâ€”organized in a clean, accessible, and maintainable way. This project emphasizes writing efficient, well-structured code and understanding how modern CSS handles traditional layout challenges.

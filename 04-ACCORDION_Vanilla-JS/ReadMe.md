## ACCORDION Application
> This project demonstrates a fully functional accordion UI component built using only **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**, with no external libraries or frameworks. The goal was to deepen my understanding of fundamental web development techniques by crafting a common UI interaction from scratch.

> The accordion allows users to expand or collapse individual sections to reveal or hide associated content, helping organize information in a compact and user-friendly way.

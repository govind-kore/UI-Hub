## PAGINATION Application (React JS)
> This project demonstrates a fully functional pagination system built with **React.JS** using useState and useEffect hooks. The objective was to practice React fundamentals like state management, side-effects, conditional rendering, and modular component design while implementing a real-world UI feature.

> The application fetches product data from a dummy API and displays it in pages of 10 items each. Users can navigate seamlessly using Previous, Next, or direct page number buttons along with page truncation logic where 5 pages can see, ensuring an intuitive and responsive browsing experience.

#### 🪶 Functionalities Covered : 
- Built with ReactJS (Functional Components + Hooks)
- Data fetching handled with useEffect and stored in component state (useState)
- Pagination logic implemented in React (slice of dataset per active page)
- Navigation via Previous / Next buttons and direct page numbers along with page Truncation
- Active page indicator highlighted for better UX
- Edge case handling (first/last page navigation disabled appropriately)
- Clean, modular code with reusable Pagination and ProductList components
- Responsive layout for smooth experience across devices

#### 🪟 Output :

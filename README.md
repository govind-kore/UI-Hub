> A collection of frontend applications built from vanilla JavaScript to advanced React and Redux projects, Showcasing UI development, modern web practices, and component-based architecture.

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of frontend applications built across various stages of modern web development.

It begins with foundational projects using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — focusing on core DOM manipulation, events, and state management without libraries.

As the repo progresses, it introduces ES6+ features, modular code architecture, and component-based design.

Advanced sections cover React.js fundamentals including functional components, hooks, routing, and state management using Redux and Redux Toolkit.

The goal is to demonstrate a clear learning path from raw frontend concepts to production-ready SPA development using industry-standard tools and best practices.

### Technologies covered:
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES5/ES6+)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- React (Hooks, React-Router-DOM)
- Redux & Redux Toolkit
- Responsive design, reusable UI components
- Modern tooling (Webpack, Babel, Prettier etc. — optional based on setup)

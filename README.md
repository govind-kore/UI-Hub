## 📌 About this Repository

This repository serves as a **comprehensive collection of frontend projects** built across different stages of modern web development.  

🟢 **Beginner stage** – Core projects using **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
  Focus: DOM manipulation, events, dynamic rendering, and state management without libraries.  

🟡 **Intermediate stage** – Introduction to **ES6+ JavaScript features**, modular code, and reusable UI patterns.  

🔵 **Advanced stage** – Applications using **React.js, React Hooks, React Router**, and **state management with Redux/Redux Toolkit (RTK)**.  
  Focus: Single Page Applications (SPA), component-based architecture, scalable patterns.  

⚡ **Professional stage** – Integrating **modern tooling and libraries** like Webpack, Babel, Jest, ESLint, Material-UI, Styled Components, and more.  
  Focus: Production-ready best practices in **testing, styling, and performance optimization**.  

The **goal** of this repo is to demonstrate a **clear learning path** from raw frontend concepts to industry-standard, production-ready development.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By maintaining this repository, I aim to:  
- Build strong **foundations in raw frontend technologies** (HTML, CSS, JS)  
- Understand **modern JavaScript features (ES6+)** and how they simplify coding  
- Practice **component-based architecture** with React  
- Learn effective **state management** using Redux & RTK  
- Master **responsive and accessible UI development** with modern libraries  
- Get hands-on experience with **tooling, bundling, and testing frameworks**  
- Develop a **portfolio of frontend projects** that showcase real-world skills

## Tabs Application
> This project demonstrates a fully functional tabbed interface created using only HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript—with no external libraries or frameworks involved. The goal was to revisit and strengthen my understanding of core web development principles by building a UI component from scratch that is commonly used in real-world applications.

> This tab component allows users to switch between different content panels by clicking on tab headers, with smooth transitions and a responsive layout.
